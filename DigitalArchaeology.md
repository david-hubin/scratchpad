# My interest in Digital Archaeology:
## An introduction

Since my introduction to archaeology as a field, the use of technology in both the collection and the analysis of archaeological data has fascinated me. First, this meant using GIS to map ongoing field excavations and finds. Next, this meant taking that data further by analyzing spatial correlations and networks. Now, I am most interested in Digital Archaeology as more than a tool, deployed in the act of doing 'regular' archaeology. I am interested in the theoretical and methodological implications of a totally digital approach, especially in regard to Public Archaeology.

> Digital archaeology is a public archaeology
Digital archaeology is often about deformance rather than justification
In that deformative practice, digital archaeology is aligned with artistic ways of knowing
Digital archaeology overlaps with digital humanities, and in many ways, presaged current debates and trends in that field.
